        The history of boba, or bubble tea, traces back to Taiwan in the 1980s. It originated from the creative innovation of a teahouse owner who added tapioca pearls to tea, creating a unique and refreshing drink. Initially, it gained popularity among teenagers and young adults in Taiwan before spreading to other parts of Asia and eventually globally.
